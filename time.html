  <p class="time-header-text"> <u>Pebble time, in a nutshell</u></p> <br>><br>
  <p class="time-review-text">Have you heard of Eric Migicovsky? Well if you haven’t, he is the founder of Pebble.<br>
        Why is he relevant? Well he brought us some of the first smartwatches to really pioneer the wearable movement.<br>
        Their latest watch is the Pebble Time, compatible with both Android and iOS. This is what it looks like:
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
You might be thinking that it kind of looks like a child’s toy, and I would tell you that you’re right, it does.<br> It doesn’t even have a touchscreen.
 Why is this watch being reviewed? I’ll tell you why, it has a <strong>week battery life, yes, 7 days of battery</strong> without charging.<br> It lasts a lot longer than something like the Moto 360 or the Apple watch.
  Oh, and did I mention it’s water resistant up to 30 meters?
  <br><br>
  It has an all plastic build and consists of an e-color ink display (this is the secret to that insane battery life it has).<br> It has 1 button on the left side and 3 on the right side.
  The button found on the left acts as a back button.<br> The first button on the right hand is used to scroll up, <br>the middle button is used as a select button and the bottom button is used to scroll down.<br>
   It charges via a magnet that attaches to the back of the watch and charges insanely fast. It’s charged within the hour.
   <br><br>
   Alright, so it’s made of plastic, has a good battery and can be used in water, what about the features? <br>It does the typical smartwatch things like receive calls, texts, and app notifications.<br>
    You can answer your calls (but not actually talk via the watch), but you can do so with texts.<br> Pebble has also added a Health feature that can track your steps throughout the day,
    distance you’ve walked and even calories burned. <br>The health aspect is very welcome to the Pebble but I’ve found it’s not very accurate.
    <br><br>
     You can control your music, set alarms, timers,
     and do whatever else you wish via the Pebble app store, which is filled with amazing apps to enhance your experience with the Time.<br> One feature that sets the watch apart is the <strong>always on watch face</strong>.
      What is one thing a watch should do?<br> It should tell the time, all the time. You shouldn’t need to raise your arm a certain way or even have to shake your wrist to be able to see the<br>
       time, I mean c’mon, it’s supposed to be a watch!
<br><br>
Let’s talk price because as much as we can go on about the amazing features the Time sports, it won’t matter if it’s out of your budget.<br> The time comes in at 200$ CAN and 150$ USD. So wait,
 it’s cheaper than most smart watches and performs just as great? Exactly.
 <br><br>
 Overall, the Pebble Time is not meant to replace your phone like a lot of other watches appear to do.<br> The Time was built to be an extension of your phone,
  and in that regard, it does exactly what it was designed to be, perfectly.
