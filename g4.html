<p class="g4-header-text"> <u>LG's latest, the G4<u></p><br><br>
<p class="g4-review-text"> Every year we get new iPhones, and new Android phones.
   It’s like a tradition, we have events to highlight the latest from Samsung, Apple, Google, and<br> every other company that thinks they have something new.
    One of the least popular of the Android manufacturers is LG.
    <br><br>
    They’ve done a lot to innovate in the past, by placing the volume and power buttons on the back of the phones and having some of the best displays on the market.<br>
     In 2015 LG gave us the G4. The G4 comes in many different configurations but is the one I have:
     <br><br>

     <br><br>
     If you’re wondering if that’s real leather, it is. They also come in several different colors such as red, blue, orange and pink.<br>
      Alright, so it’s a well designed phone, what else? It features microSD storage up to 2 TB, yes 2TB of storage, that’s more than a lot of people have on their computers.<br>
       It also has a 3000mAh removable battery. Yea, it’s got what a lot of Android phones have abandoned over the years, all while keeping a fairly good build quality.
       <br><br>
       Let me tell you that the feeling you get when you look at the phone quickly goes away when you’re actually using it.<br>
        This phone is running LG’s UX on top of Android 6.0.1. Why is that a bad thing? The icons are ugly, the quick settings are even worst,<br>
         and the app drawer, just not pleasing to my eye at all. On the plus side it does feature some neat things you wouldn’t<br> find in stock Android like dual-window capabilities,
         and knock to wake up and sleep the phone.
         <br><br>
         Alright, so it’s beautiful from the outside but not so much on the inside? Exactly.<br>
          Alright, so it features some neat things like expandable storage and a removable battery, it does, but if you want something to set it apart, here it is.<br> The camera.
           Yes, you read it right, the camera on the G4 is like no other. The only other phone to compete with the G4’s camera is the 6S and the S6 (In 2015).<br>
           I’ll be the first to admit that I am no photographer, and am not the best at taking pictures. Just look at this shot I took, keep in mind this is me pointing the G4 and taking the picture.<br>
           This was taken when I was downtown Ottawa for the day.
           <br><br>

           <br><br>
           Is it a perfect shot? Probably not. Is it bad? Certainly not. I should also mention that the G4 features a manual mode for the camera, exactly like a DSLR.<br>
            Want to change the ISO? White balance? Shutter speed? Tweak it as much as your heart desires because it’s all here.
            <br><br>
            Good design? Check. Good software? Meh. Good features? Check. Camera? Check. <br>At the end of the day, you’ll be more than happy with the G4, why? Because it’ll still be alive,
             the battery life on this thing is incredible (seriously).<br> It’s a top of the line Android phone with some features that other phones can’t claim. <br>If you’re looking for something that is
             cheaper than a lot of other phones and performs just as well the G4 is for you.
             <br><br>
