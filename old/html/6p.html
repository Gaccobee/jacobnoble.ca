  <p class="nexus-header-text"> <u>Google's best, the 6P </u> </p><br><br>
<p class="nexus-review-text"> Stock android holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts in the tech world. Luckily, this is what Google provides us with every year.<br>
Nexus used to be a developer's dream from Google. In the past few years Google has moven away from that and is giving us more expensive and quality phones.<br>
This year we were given the 6P and the 5X.
<br><br>
When you first look at the 6P you'll immediately notice it's unique design.<br> It's sporting a visor where the camera and all the antennas lie for the phone to properly operate.<br>
It's also got an impressingly fast fingerprint sensor. This is easily Google's best designed phone, ever. (Have you seen it?)<br><br>

So it looks good, but does it feel good? Of course. Did I mention it's an all aluminium body?<br> You get cold touching the 6P in the morning, it really is a beautiful thing.<br>
You'll also notice just how light it is when you first pick it up, it's not top heavy with the visor being present either.<br> It's a bit slippery but if you're careful you'll make do.
On the right hand side you have the volume rocker and the sleep/wake button.<br> The top of the phone is where you'll find the headphone jack.<br> If you're living in the US, UK or Australia
you'll be happy to know it's Android Pay ready and if you're in Canada, well at least we can use Android beam, right?<br><br>

If you're anything like me you'll want a phone with a good battery life, does the 6P have it? Yes<br>. An average day for me with my 6P lasts about 15 hours. It will get me through that easily
with about 15% left at the end of the day.<br> In the rare event that it dies, it's easily and quickly charged back up through the USB C port. Unfortunately this phone does not sport
wireless charging.<br><br>

<br><br>
Remember when I mentioned stock android? This is easily the selling point for this phone.<br> Fast and continous updates? Check! Best looking version of Android? Check! Less bloatware
than other Android manufacturers? Check!<br> If you're into getting the latest versions of Android, you'll be happy to hear you can enroll this device in Android betas (like Android N) to
get a preview at new and upcoming features.<br> This phone really is a dream both on the outside and the inside.
<br><br>
Let's talk about the camera, after all, you need to be able to capture those precious life moments. <br>If you're looking for the best pictures, you'll certainly be at home here.
Google's camera app is a bit barebones compared to something from Samsung or even LG.<br> When it comes to taking photos you have 6 different resolutions to shoot with. You can also
record in 4K with the back camera and 1080p through the front camera.<br> Google also includes a Photo sphere, panorama, lens blur and slow motion modes which are all very fun to play with for
a while, you'll most likely get bored after a while.<br> Sometimes the 6P doesn't focus that fast or won't focus if the subject is too close but it will usually perform just fine.<br>
It almost seems a bit simple to be on such a feature packed device like the Nexus.
<br><br>
Should you buy this phone? Most definitely.<br> It's a phone that's built to last, both hardware and software wise. It has the latest specs and will be updated by Google for the next 2-3 years.<br>
Your wallet will be more than happy when you won't need to replace it any time soon!<br><br>
