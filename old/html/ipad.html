<p class="ipad-header-text"> <u>A look at the iPad Air 2 </u> </p> <br> <br>
<p class="ipad-review-text"> Who needs a tablet? Chances are, if you’re viewing this right now, you might be in the market for one. <br>
  Why should you care about the Air 2? A tablet is supposed to fill the gap between a smartphone and a laptop, right? <br>
   The iPad air 2 is Apple’s latest attempt at trying to do that very thing. <br> <br>

   What first impresses me when looking at a new product is it’s design.<br>
   If you’re familiar with any of Apple’s other products, you won’t be surprised that it looks stunning, I mean, just look at it! <br><br>

   What sets this apart from the rest of the competition? It’s the <strong>most powerful</strong> tablet you’re able to purchase at this very moment (At the time this was written).<br>
    What does that mean for you? You’re getting a <strong>very fluid</strong> experience using this tablet.<br>
   As the name suggests, you’re getting a very thin and light tablet, which is a necessity if you’re going to be using this iPad for any length of time.<br>
     This tablet is using Apple’s A8X chip. It performs incredibly well, with this Apple was able to optimize iOS to be as energy efficient as possible.<br><br>

      This means one thing: <strong>amazing battery life</strong>. I can easily not charge this iPad for weeks at a time, while getting some use out of it. <br>
      It even has an incredibly sharp display, coming in at a resolution of 2048×1536. If you’re asking about the camera, stop.<br>
       Seriously, chances are if you have this iPad, or are thinking of getting it, you have a smartphone to accompany it. <br>
       Don’t use this for pictures (You’re doing us all a favor). <br><br>

       As I mentioned before, this tablet is running iOS 9.<br>
        This means that the Air 2 has some <strong>extremely useful</strong> features such as split-screen multitasking and Siri has been improved tremendously.<br>
        This is what multitasking on the Air 2 looks like:<br><br>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/eoNm0ks.jpg" alt="iPadAir2Multi" width="375px" height="275px"><br><br>

        Let me be the first to tell you that this is one very welcome feature. It truly helps with getting stuff done on the iPad.<br>
         After all, a tablet should be bridging the gap between a smartphone and a laptop, right?<br>
          It also helps bridge that gap if you spring for more storage, instead of 16gb base configuration Apple offers.<br><br>

          Let’s talk about one thing that will be the ultimate factor on whether or not you’ll be purchasing this tablet, price.<br>
           Starting at 549$ CAN and 420$ USD, this tablet is fairly expensive. Chances are you’ll want to upgrade the storage which will cost even more.<br><br>
            Is it worth it? That’s up to you. If it were me, I’d choose this iPad over any other tablet time and time again. <br><br>
